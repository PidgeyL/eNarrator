eNarrator
=========

eNarrator is a project for people who are too busy (or lazy ;) ) to read
 their books. eNarrator can narrate your audiobooks for you, so you can
 continue your work, while listening to your favourite ebooks.

eNarrator is written for python3, and currently only supports the epub
 format. It will attempt to use Google's online service for narrating,
 and if that fails, will use the native narrator instead.

This project is currently only tested on Ubuntu 14.04, with python3. As
 it is a quick hack for something I needed, I might not add support for
 other platforms or keep backwards compatibility in mind. Contributions
 are of course welcome.
